Problem of Browsing the PDF
---------------------------
> If the admin browses the pdf from home then it will be local to the Admin's home computer but we planned it to be local to the server.
> SO, we have to make this a upload rather than just a browse
> Also, if that has to be done then remote upload facility can also be given by using wget
> We have to have a script that will manage the upload and have to keep the pdfs safe and organised under a directory structure
> This will initiate the verify script


Problem if deleted old result and re-added
------------------------------------------
> If a result of some previous batch is deleted
> Then the converned tables are dropped
> When the same is re-added it forms correct information for the regular students but fails in info about the reappears
> The reappear info is provided by later batch results
> This must run the reappear script of the all later batches
